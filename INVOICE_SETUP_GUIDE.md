# Invoice Feature Setup Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

Follow these steps to get the invoice system running:

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-migration-invoices.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration
6. Verify success: You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to verify:
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name = 'invoices';
```
You should see `invoices` in the results.

### Step 3: Test Invoice Creation
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Navigate to any booking in the admin panel:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/admin/bookings/[id]
   ```
3. Scroll to the bottom
4. Click **"Create Invoice"** button
5. You'll be redirected to the invoice page
6. Click **"Print Invoice"** to test the print layout

### Step 4: Customize Company Details
Edit the file: `src/app/admin/invoices/[id]/page.tsx`

Find and update these sections:

**Company Header (around line 155-170):**
```tsx
<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal font-playfair mb-2">
  Eleventh Hour Cleaning
</h1>
<p className="text-gray-600">Premium Cleaning Services</p>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">London, UK</p>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">info@eleventhhourkleaning.co.uk</p>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">+44 20 XXXX XXXX</p>
```

**Bank Details (around line 290-300):**
```tsx
<div>
  <p className="font-medium text-brand-charcoal mb-1">Bank Transfer:</p>
  <p>Account Name: Eleventh Hour Cleaning Ltd</p>
  <p>Sort Code: XX-XX-XX</p>
  <p>Account Number: XXXXXXXX</p>
</div>
```

**Payment Terms (around line 300-305):**
```tsx
<div>
  <p className="font-medium text-brand-charcoal mb-1">Terms:</p>
  <p>Payment due within 14 days of invoice date unless otherwise agreed.</p>

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Could not find the table 'public.invoices'"
**Cause:** Database migration not run yet
**Solution:** Run the SQL migration file in Supabase SQL Editor

### Issue: Invoice number is NULL
**Cause:** Trigger not created properly
**Solution:** Re-run the migration, verify trigger:
```sql
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_generate_invoice_number';
```

### Issue: Print layout looks wrong
**Solution:**
- Set print margins to "Default" in print dialog
- Disable "Headers and footers"
- Select A4 paper size
- Use landscape if needed for wide content

### Issue: Invoice shows wrong amount
**Cause:** Booking total needs to be saved first
**Solution:** Save the booking before creating invoice

## Usage Examples

### Create an Invoice via UI
1. Go to booking: `/admin/bookings/[booking-id]`
2. Click "Create Invoice"
3. System auto-redirects to invoice page
4. Invoice is in "draft" status

### Create an Invoice via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "bookingId": "uuid-of-booking",
    "due_date": "2025-10-28"
  }'
```

### Update Invoice Status
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invoices/[invoice-id] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "paid"}'
```

### Get All Invoices for a Booking
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invoices?bookingId=[booking-id]
```

## Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Customer Paid via Bank Transfer
1. Create invoice for booking (status: draft)
2. Print invoice and send to customer
3. Update status to "sent"
4. After payment received, update to "paid"

### Scenario 2: Upfront Payment Required
1. Create invoice for booking
2. Send invoice link to customer
3. Mark as "sent"
4. Wait for payment confirmation
5. Update to "paid"
6. Booking can proceed

### Scenario 3: Refund Issued
1. Find original invoice (status: paid)
2. Update status to "void"
3. Create new invoice with negative amount (if needed)
4. Or adjust booking total and create credit note

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Add Company Logo

2. Update invoice template line 155:
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-4">
  <img src="/el_logo.png" alt="Eleventh Hour Cleaning" className="h-16" />
  <div>
    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Eleventh Hour Cleaning</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Email Invoices to Customers
Add an email button that sends the invoice:
```tsx
const handleEmail = async () => {
  await fetch('/api/admin/invoices/send-email', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ invoiceId: invoice.id })
  })
}
```

### 3. PDF Generation
Use a library like `jsPDF` or `react-pdf` to generate downloadable PDFs:
```bash
npm install jspdf html2canvas
```
