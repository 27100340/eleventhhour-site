# Troubleshooting Guide - Stripe Integration

## "An unexpected error occurred" when clicking "Proceed to Payment"

### Step 1: Check Your Terminal/Console Logs

**Open your terminal where `npm run dev` is running** and look for error messages when you click the button. You should see logs like:

```
üìù Creating Stripe checkout session...
üì¶ Payload received: { bookingId: 'xxx', itemCount: 2 }
üîÑ Creating Stripe session with origin: http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ Stripe session created: cs_test_xxx
```

If you see a ‚ùå error message, that tells you what went wrong.

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click "Proceed to Payment" again
4. Look for red error messages

Common errors:
- "Failed to fetch" ‚Üí Server not running or API route issue
- "Network error" ‚Üí Check if dev server is running
- Stripe errors ‚Üí Check API keys

### Step 3: Run the Database Migration

**This is the most likely cause!**

If you haven't run the database migration yet, the webhook won't be able to update the booking status (though the payment will still work).

**To fix:**
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/biacudctwrcjtlmzetlj/sql
2. Copy the contents of `supabase-migration-stripe.sql`
3. Paste and click "Run"

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables

Run this command:
```bash
node verify-stripe-setup.js
```

You should see all checkmarks ‚úÖ. If any are ‚ùå, check your `.env.local` file.

### Step 5: Restart Dev Server

After making changes, restart your server:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Stripe secret key not configured"
**Fix:** Check `.env.local` has `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...`

### Issue: "No items provided"
**Fix:** Make sure you selected at least one service with quantity > 0

### Issue: "Failed to create checkout session"
**Fix:** Check terminal logs for the specific Stripe error

### Issue: Payment succeeds but booking status doesn't update
**Fix:**
1. Run database migration (see Step 3 above)
2. For webhooks to work in production, you need to set up webhook secret

### Issue: "Failed to load payment system"
**Fix:** Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env.local`

## How to Get Detailed Error Info

### 1. Check Server Logs (Terminal)
Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. The API now logs:
- ‚úÖ Success messages (green)
- ‚ùå Error messages (red)
- üì¶ Payload information

### 2. Check Browser Console
Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab ‚Üí Look for errors when clicking the button

### 3. Check Network Tab
Press F12 ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Click "Proceed to Payment" ‚Üí Look for:
- `/api/public/booking` - Should return 200 with booking ID
- `/api/create-checkout-session` - Should return 200 with session ID

If either returns an error (400, 500), click on it to see the error message.

## Test the Integration Step by Step

### Test 1: Booking Creation
1. Fill out form
2. Select a service
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. Check if booking is created in Supabase database

### Test 2: Stripe Session Creation
1. Check terminal logs after clicking "Proceed to Payment"
2. Should see: "‚úÖ Stripe session created: cs_test_xxx"

### Test 3: Stripe Redirect
1. After Stripe session is created
2. You should be redirected to Stripe's checkout page
3. URL should start with: `https://checkout.stripe.com/`

### Test 4: Payment
1. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. Any future expiry date
3. Any 3-digit CVC
4. Should redirect to success page

## Still Having Issues?

### Check These Files:
1. `.env.local` - Contains correct Stripe keys
2. `package.json` - Has `stripe` and `@stripe/stripe-js` packages
3. `supabase-migration-stripe.sql` - Was run in Supabase

### Get More Details:
1. Look at terminal logs (server-side errors)
2. Look at browser console (client-side errors)
3. Check Network tab in DevTools (API call details)

### Quick Test Command:
```bash
# Verify Stripe configuration
node verify-stripe-setup.js

# Should output:
# ‚úÖ Stripe API connection successful!
```

## Need Help?

When reporting an issue, please provide:
1. Terminal logs (copy the error from where `npm run dev` is running)
2. Browser console logs (F12 ‚Üí Console ‚Üí copy the error)
3. Network tab details (F12 ‚Üí Network ‚Üí click failed request ‚Üí copy response)
4. What step you're on (booking creation, payment, redirect, etc.)
